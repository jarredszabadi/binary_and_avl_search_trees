binary_and_avl_search_trees
===========================
AVLDictionary and BSTDictionary implement the Dictionary interface
AVLNodes and BSTNodes use SortableString as their Key types


To run the simulation execute the DictionaryTest.java file.


This will insert entries, calculate the depth, delete entries, prints, 
and search for specific entries in each tree.
